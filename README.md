# Calculator
------------------
------------------
This is the final project from foundations section of The Odin Project. The task was to create a easy to use calculator for a user. 


Understand, Breakdown, Plan, Pseudocode, Code, Evaluate and Test, Sleep, Repeat...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I had to breakdown and evaluate the problem down several times in an effort to understand how different functions and variables interact with each other.
- Once I was satisfied that a feature on the calculator was implmented and tested thoroughly with no bugs or glitches, I moved onto creating the next feature. 


Lessons Learnt...
-----------------
- There's always lessons to be learnt. And in this case it was to commit often and early as possible! I got to a stage where the calculator was no longer working due to a feature being implemented.
The problem was eventually solved by utilising chrome debugger and console.logs to step back through the code.


Future improvements:
--------------------
- The calculator project could have more tools at its disposal if required. An example is implementing the exponent, factorial, or even Fibonacci feature. 
Or perhaps having a "save data" feature which appends previous calculations to somewhere on the webpage. 
- Utilising other web designs from CSS frameworks.
